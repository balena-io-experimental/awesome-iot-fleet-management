# How to contribute

We welcome any edge developers, IoT fleet managers, makers, builders, and curious technologists to contribute to this guide.

**The goal:** Empower anyone to become more comfortable and proficient with creating edge and IoT projects at scale.

## Maker / Builder / Edge developer / IoT know-how

Share your knowledge with the masses. Find a topic that you have expertise in and share your knowledge. Edit and existing topic to improve its contents.

## Fleet management know-how

If you spend more time managing tens to thousands of devices at scale, we want your knowledge and expertise as well.

## Information architecture & design

Are you curious about the topic, but your skills are more around organizing information, writing, design, and user experience? Feel free to contribute here as well. We'll need help in creating diagrams, models, and organizing information to best serve the community.

## More to come

We'll improve these contribution guidelines over time. TL;DR: Everyone is welcome.
